# AUTHREACT

Hi everyone!! I'm Following a tutorial from Stephen Grider if you are interesting to learning check his classes here
Udemy tutorial: [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

It is a practice project to learn and understand better **React, Redux with previous elements that I've been studying like: Route, HOC, etc**. Now the new element to study is **Redux Thunk**. Also this project is to get an idea how to work as a Fullstack (My backend skills are still low, right now I'm focus to try to be better on Frontend, but I realize that backend I don't have to put far away - A reminder to myself jajajaja xD).

The project as entire thing is an authentication form (Sign In, Sign Up and Sign Out). This will be divided in two part.

## Client Part

In this part we going to work with the elements I mentioned before about react. The idea here is to build a form that take the email and password to get access. It'll have Sign In, Sign Up and Sign Out. If you insert an error or the email that you try to insert it's been used the form will show up the alert message.

### Requirements

* Install dependencies (Client and Server have different packages).
```
npm install
```
* To start the project insert this command
```
npm start
```
or
```
npm run start
```
**Remember to run correctly the client part you have keep running mongoDB (Database) and the server part**
